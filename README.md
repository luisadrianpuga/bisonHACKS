# AllergiScan - bisonHACKS

If compliled, this project will deploy to an android application that will use the phones camera to scan candy to give a user allergen information.

## Description

Our project consists of python code using the Kivy framework to all it to deploy to both android and iOS. The code uses the devices camera to scan barcodes and QR codes from products to cross check it with contents in a database. This application will allow for the facilitation of allergen information to the general public by producing a filter that allows them to know what they are consuming and whether it will cause them any harm. This project is the minimal viable product which means it will require greater efforts if it is to be deployed to the general public as it is currently limited by the database, hence we require additional data to eventually have this recognize everything in an American grocery store.
